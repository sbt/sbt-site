# sbt-site

This sbt plugin generates project websites from static content, [GitBook], [Paradox], [Nanoc], and/or [Asciidoctor], and can optionally include generated Scaladoc. It is designed to work hand-in-hand with publishing plugins like [sbt-ghpages].

For version 1.5.0 we removed the integrations with [Jekyll], [Sphinx], [Pamflet], [Hugo], and [Laika] as they require updates. Please see the ["revive" issues](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-site/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+revive).
