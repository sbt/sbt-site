It assumes that you have already configured your sbt project to publish your site using the sbt-ghpages plugin as described in the previous section.\nSecurity Considerations The authentication mechanism that enables Travis CI to update the gh-pages branch requires that write access to your GitHub project is granted to an SSH key pair that you control. An encrypted version of the secret key must be added to the Git repository in order for Travis CI to decrypt it and make it available for pushing to your Git repository. This means that anyone with the ability to modify the Travis CI or sbt build configuration will be able to get hold of the secret key and gain write access to your GitHub repository. For this reason it is recommented to disable publishing for pull requests. The instructions are based on this gist and you are encouraged to consult the reasons for choosing this authentication mechanism.\nTo authenticate Travis CI to publish changes to the gh-pages branch you need to first generate an SSH key pair:\n$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"sbt-site@travis\" -f project/travis-deploy-key\nAdd the public key found in project/travis-deploy-key.pub as a deploy key in the Deploy Keys section of your GitHub project’s settings page at https://github.com/[org]/[repo]/settings/keys. Make sure you allow write access for the deploy key by clicking the check box.\nPrepare the secret key for inclusion in the repository by opening a terminal and encrypting the secret key file using the Travis CLI:\n$ gem install travis\n$ travis encrypt-file project/travis-deploy-key project/travis-deploy-key.enc\nencrypting project/travis-deploy-key for [org]/[repo]\nstoring result as project/travis-deploy-key.enc\nstoring secure env variables for decryption\n\nPlease add the following to your build script (before_install stage in your .travis.yml, for instance):\n\n    openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_3afbfedfa397_key -iv $encrypted_3afbfedfa397_iv -in project/travis-deploy-key.enc -out project/travis-deploy-key -d\n\nPro Tip: You can add it automatically by running with --add.\n\nMake sure to add project/travis-deploy-key.enc to the git repository.\nMake sure not to add project/travis-deploy-key to the git repository.\nCommit all changes to your .travis.yml.\nAs instructed in the output of the command add the encrypted secret key found in project/travis-deploy-key.enc to the repository and delete or ignore the unencrypted secret key file.\n$ git add project/travis-deploy-key.enc\n$ echo project/travis-deploy-key >> .git/info/exclude\nFinally, configure a deploy step in .travis.yml using the script provider. For a complete set of options and triggers see the Travis deployment documentation. In this example, we publishing when a tag is created and explicitly disable publishing for pull request. The before_deploy step takes care of setting up the environment so that git push automatically finds the deploy key.\nbefore_deploy:\n  # Record minimal build information via the Git user ident\n  - git config --global user.name \"$USER\"\n  - git config --global user.email \"$TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER@$TRAVIS_COMMIT\"\n  # Decrypt the secret deploy key using instructions from `travis encrypt-file`\n  - openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_3afbfedfa397_key -iv $encrypted_3afbfedfa397_iv -in project/travis-deploy-key.enc -out project/travis-deploy-key -d\n  - chmod 600 project/travis-deploy-key\n  # Start ssh-agent in the background and load the deploy key\n  - eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n  - ssh-add project/travis-deploy-key\n\ndeploy:\n  provider: script\n  script: sbt ghpagesPushSite\n  skip_cleanup: true\n  on:\n    tags: true\n    condition: $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST = false && $SBT_CROSS_VERSION = 0.13*\nNote Ensure that you modify the above example to use the instructions on how to decrypt the deploy key provided in the output of the travis encrypt-file command.

You won’t be able to publish without them. Make sure the working directory is clean and up-to-date with the remote, and the tests pass (e.g. sbt scripted). Some people like to run git clean -fdx. Start the release branch process: Give the release branch a version name with the form v<X>.<Y>.<Z>: You should now be on the release branch: Create the file src/main/paradox/notes/<X>.<Y>.<Z>.md. Sometimes this file already exists if PR submitters are super awesome. Go through the commit logs and collect the major new features, bug fixes, deprecations, and anything else relevant to users. Making note of breaking changes is particularly important. See previous release notes for format/content conventions. Edit the version setting in build.sbt to match \"<X>.<Y>.<Z>\" Commit your current changes onto the release branch. Run sbt bintrayWhoami to confirm your publishing credentials are set up. See sbt documentation on how to get set up with Bintray. Run sbt ^publish to build the packages and stage artifacts on Bintray. Confirm the plugin is properly staged for release on Bintray. You should see a message that looks looks like this: Run sbt ^bintrayRelease. This moves the plugin from the staged release to published release on Bintray. Finish release per GitFlow process: Accept the defaults: GitFlow will merge release onto master and develop, and switch the current branch to develop. You must push changes yourself to both develop and master. Create a release entry in GitHub. Because GitFlow automatically adds a tag to the history, GitHub picks it up as a release… …but we have to copy the release notes from our src/main/paradox/notes/<X>.<Y>.<Z>.md file manually. Monitor the TravicCI build and make sure it updates the manual with the latest version. Announce release using herald. Also announce release on Twitter, including #scala and @scala_sbt and major contributor handles (if available). Provide a link to the GitHub release page in tweet. Announce on #sbt-site and #sbt-dev Gitter channels. Important: On the develop branch, edit the version setting in build.sbt to match \"<X>.<Y+1>.0-SNAPSHOT\". Commit and push.","title":"Release"}]}
