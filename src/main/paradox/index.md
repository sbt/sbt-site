# sbt-site

This sbt plugin generates project websites from static content as well as @ref:[third-party generators](generators/index.md) and can optionally include generated Scaladoc. It is designed to work hand-in-hand with publishing plugins like [sbt-ghpages].

Before upgrading please consult the @github:[release notes](/notes/). Instructions for upgrading from older versions can be found in the @ref:[migration guide](migration-guide.md).
