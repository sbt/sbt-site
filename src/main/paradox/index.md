# sbt-site

This sbt plugin generates project websites from static content as well as @ref:[third-party generators](generators/index.md) and can optionally include generated Scaladoc. It is designed to work hand-in-hand with publishing plugins like [sbt-ghpages].

Before upgrading please consult the @github:[release notes](/notes/). Instructions for upgrading from a version before 1.x.x can be found in the @ref:[migration guide](migration-guide.md#from-version-0.x.x-to-1.x.x).

@@@ note

* Version 1.3+ is cross published to both sbt 0.13 and sbt 1.x.
* As of sbt-site version 1.x.x, sbt version 0.13.10+ or 1.0.0-RC2+ is supported.
